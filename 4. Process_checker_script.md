# Process Checker Script
> **Goal:**
- Take a process name as input.
- Check if the process is running.
- Print whether it is Running or Not Running.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Ask for process name
read -p "Enter the process name to check: " process

# Check if process is running
if pgrep -x "$process" > /dev/null; then
    echo "Process '$process' is running."
else
    echo "Process '$process' is not running."
fi
```
> How it works:
- pgrep -x "$process" → checks for the process with exact name match.
- If found → prints "running"; otherwise → prints "not running".

## Process checker with start option prompt:
- It asks for the process name.
- Checks if it’s running.
- If it’s not running, it will prompt you Yes/No whether you want to start it.
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Ask for process name
read -p "Enter the process name to check: " process

# Check if process is running
if pgrep -x "$process" > /dev/null; then
    echo "Process '$process' is running."
else
    echo "Process '$process' is not running."
    
    # Ask user whether to start the process
    read -p "Do you want to start the process? (yes/no): " choice
    
    if [[ "$choice" == "yes" || "$choice" == "y" ]]; then
        # Try to start using systemctl
        if sudo systemctl start "$process" 2>/dev/null; then
            echo "Process '$process' started successfully."
        else
            echo "Failed to start '$process'. Make sure the service exists and is installed."
        fi
    else
        echo "Process '$process' will not be started."
    fi
fi
```
