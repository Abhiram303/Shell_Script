# User Creation Script
> **Goal:**
- Take a username as input. 
- Check if the user already exists.
- If not, create the user and set a default password.
- Print a confirmation message
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Ask for username
read -p "Enter the username to create: " username

# Check if user already exists
if id "$username" &>/dev/null; then
    echo "User '$username' already exists!"
else
    # Create user
    sudo useradd "$username"
    
    # Set default password (you can change 'Password123' to something else)
    echo "Password123" | sudo passwd --stdin "$username" 2>/dev/null || echo "$username:Password123" | sudo chpasswd
    
    echo "User '$username' created successfully!"
    echo "Default password: Password123"
fi
```
> **How it works:**

1.  id "$username" checks if the user exists.
2.  If not, useradd creates the user.
3.  passwd --stdin or chpasswd sets a default password.
4.  Prints confirmation with username and password.

## Creating a User with password setting prompt in secure way 

- Take the username as input.
- Prompt for a password securely (without showing it on the screen).
- Create the user and set the entered password.
- Print a success message.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Ask for username
read -p "Enter the username to create: " username

# Check if user already exists
if id "$username" &>/dev/null; then
    echo "User '$username' already exists!"
else
    # Ask for password securely
    read -s -p "Enter password for $username: " password
    echo
    read -s -p "Confirm password for $username: " password2
    echo

    # Check if passwords match
    if [ "$password" != "$password2" ]; then
        echo "Passwords do not match. Exiting."
        exit 1
    fi

    # Create user
    sudo useradd "$username"
    
    # Set the entered password
    echo "$username:$password" | sudo chpasswd
    
    echo "User '$username' created successfully with the given password!"
fi
```
> **How this works:**
- read -s hides password input on screen.
- password2 confirms the password to avoid typos.
- chpasswd sets the username and password securely.
